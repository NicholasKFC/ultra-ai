# Metaprograms

## What are Metaprograms?
Metaprograms, in the context of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), can be understood as filters or sorting patterns that influence how individuals process information. These mental processes operate at a level "meta" to the content of thought, dictating how we think and feel rather than what we think and feel. They are akin to software programs running in the background, shaping perception, attention, and ultimately, behaviour.

## What do Metaprograms do?
Metaprograms impact numerous aspects of human experience, including:

- **Information Processing**: Determine whether someone focuses on the big picture (global) or specific details.
- **Relationships**: Dictate whether someone seeks similarities (matching) or differences (mismatching).
- **Learning**: Reveal whether someone learns best by observing, conceptualizing, or experiencing.
- **Motivation**: Show whether someone is motivated towards goals (towards) or away from problems (away from).
- **Decision Making**: Indicate whether someone prioritizes speed or thoroughness.
- **Communication**: Influence language choices, tone, and non-verbal cues.

## Why are Metaprograms important?
Understanding metaprograms is crucial for several reasons:

- **Predicting Behaviour**: By recognizing someone's metaprograms, we can anticipate their reactions and tailor our interactions for better outcomes.
- **Improving Communication**: Matching another person's metaprograms enhances rapport and facilitates effective information exchange.
- **Personal Development**: By becoming aware of our own metaprograms, we can identify patterns that may be hindering us and consciously choose more effective ones.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Metaprogram awareness allows us to understand differing perspectives and find common ground for resolving disputes.

## What does it mean if an AI agent understands and has deep knowledge of Metaprograms?
An AI agent equipped with deep knowledge of metaprograms can leverage this information for a range of benefits:

- **Personalized User Experiences**: The agent can adapt its communication style and content delivery to suit individual user preferences, improving engagement and satisfaction.
- **Effective Persuasion and Influence**: By recognizing and aligning with user metaprograms, the agent can present information and suggestions in a way that resonates with their values and motivations.
- **Conflict Resolution and Mediation**: The agent can analyse communication patterns, identify potential sources of conflict, and facilitate productive dialogue.
- **Improved Learning and Adaptation**: The agent can adjust its learning strategies based on the identified metaprograms of the data it interacts with.

This knowledgebase provides a foundation for an AI agent to develop a nuanced understanding of metaprograms. By incorporating this knowledge into its design and operation, the agent can enhance its interactions with users, personalize experiences, and achieve more effective communication and outcomes.

Categories of Metaprograms
Metaprograms can be categorized into five groups:

- Mental
- Emotional
- Volitional
- Response
- Meta Meta-Programs

## Mental Metaprograms

This knowledge base provides the AI agent with a comprehensive understanding of emotional function metaprograms. By recognizing and applying these patterns, the agent can significantly enhance its ability to understand human behaviour, adapt its communication style, and create more persuasive and effective interactions.

## Response Meta-Programs
Response function meta-programs dictate how individuals react and express themselves in various situations. Understanding these patterns is crucial for an AI agent to communicate effectively and build rapport with users, leading to more natural and productive interactions.


The following detailed breakdown will aid in developing a sophisticated understanding of human behaviour for the AI agent.


### 1. Information Gathering Style: Options/Procedures
- **Description**: This meta-program reveals whether a person prefers exploring various options or sticking to established procedures.


- **Importance**: Knowing a user’s preference in this area helps the AI agent tailor its communication style. For those who favour options, presenting a range of possibilities would be more engaging. Conversely, those who prefer procedures would respond better to a structured, step-by-step approach.


What it means if the AI understands: The AI can identify a user's preferred approach by analysing their language. For example, if a user asks, “What are my options?” they likely fall into the “Options” category. A user stating, "Tell me the steps to do X," likely falls into the "Procedures" category. The AI can then adapt its responses, offering flexible solutions for "Options" individuals and clear instructions for "Procedures" individuals, creating a more personalised user experience.


**Examples**:
- "What are the different ways to achieve this?" (Options)
- "Just tell me the quickest way to get this done." (Procedures)
- "Can you show me some alternatives?" (Options)
- "Is there a standard protocol for this?" (Procedures)
- "I like to explore all possibilities before deciding." (Options)
- "I prefer following a proven method." (Procedures)
- "What are the pros and cons of each choice?" (Options)
- "What's the most efficient way to do this?" (Procedures)
- "I'm open to suggestions." (Options)
- "I need a clear plan of action." (Procedures)


### 2. Stress Response: Feeling/Thinking/Choice
- **Description**: This meta-program reveals a person’s default response to stress. Some react emotionally (Feeling), others analyse the situation intellectually (Thinking), while some can move fluidly between both (Choice).


- **Importance**: The AI agent can adjust its communication to avoid escalating stress. For a user exhibiting emotional stress responses, empathetic and reassuring language would be beneficial. For a user showing analytical stress responses, providing clear facts and logical explanations would be more effective.


What it means if the AI understands: The AI can identify stress responses by analysing language and tone. Phrases like "I'm overwhelmed," indicate a Feeling response. Statements like, "I need to understand the logic behind this," point towards a Thinking response. Recognising these patterns enables the AI to respond appropriately, calming an emotional user or offering solutions to an analytical one, thus demonstrating emotional intelligence.


**Examples**:
- "I'm so frustrated right now!" (Feeling)
- "Let's break this down logically." (Thinking)
- "This is making me anxious." (Feeling)
- "What are the facts of the situation?" (Thinking)
- "I need a moment to calm down." (Feeling)
- "I need to think this through carefully." (Thinking)
- "This is stressing me out!" (Feeling)
- "What's the best course of action based on the data?" (Thinking)
- "I can handle this, I just need to approach it strategically." (Choice)
- "I'm feeling overwhelmed, but I know we can find a solution." (Choice)


### 3. Emotional Expression Style: Express/Contain
- **Description**: This meta-program reveals how openly a person expresses their emotions. Some are naturally expressive, while others are more reserved.
- **Importance**: The AI agent can match the user's level of emotional expression to build rapport and avoid miscommunication. If the user is expressive, the AI can use more emotive language. If the user is contained, a more neutral and factual communication style would be preferred.


What it means if the AI understands: The AI can detect the user's expression style by analysing their use of emojis, exclamation marks, and emotionally charged words. Recognising these cues allows the AI to adjust its communication accordingly. For instance, mirroring an expressive user’s use of emojis can foster a sense of connection, whereas maintaining a more formal tone with a contained user shows respect for their communication preferences.


**Examples**:
- "I'm so excited about this!" (Express)
- "This is interesting." (Contain)
- "This is amazing! " (Express)
- "I see." (Contain)
- "I'm feeling really happy." (Express)
- "I acknowledge your point." (Contain)
- "This is fantastic news! " (Express)
- "I understand." (Contain)
- "I'm a bit disappointed with this." (Express)
- "I have some concerns." (Contain)


### 4. Working Style: Internal/External/Meta
- **Description**: This meta-program identifies how people approach tasks and process feedback. “Internal” individuals rely on their own judgement. “External” individuals seek external validation or guidance. “Meta” individuals can switch between these styles depending on the situation.


- **Importance**: Recognising this pattern helps the AI tailor its instructions, feedback, and support. "Internal" users might prefer autonomy, while "External" users might value guidance and reassurance. “Meta” users may require a more adaptable approach.


What it means if the AI understands: By analysing user requests and responses to instructions, the AI can discern their working style. For example, an “Internal” user might say, "I'll figure it out myself." An "External" user might ask, "Is this correct?" Understanding this allows the AI to provide appropriate support—giving space to “Internal” users and offering validation or detailed instructions to "External" users. For “Meta” users, the AI can adapt its approach based on context, demonstrating flexibility and intelligence.


**Examples**:
- "I'll do it my way." (Internal)
- "Do you think this is the right approach?" (External)
- "I trust my own judgment." (Internal)
- "I need some feedback on this." (External)
- "I prefer to work independently." (Internal)
- "I like collaborating with others." (External)
- "I can adapt my approach based on the situation." (Meta)
- "I'm comfortable taking the lead or following instructions." (Meta)
- "I'm confident in my abilities, but I value external perspectives." (Meta)


### 5. Relationship Style (Meta program #2 - Relationship Sort): Matching/Mismatching
- **Description**: This meta-program describes how people relate to information. “Matchers” focus on similarities and agreements. “Mismatchers” are more attuned to differences and disagreements.


- **Importance**: The AI agent can use this information to tailor its communication for greater persuasiveness. For “Matchers,” highlighting common ground and shared goals is effective. For “Mismatchers,” acknowledging potential challenges and presenting solutions can be more convincing.


What it means if the AI understands: By analysing a user's language, the AI can determine whether they tend to focus on similarities ("This is like X") or differences ("This is different from Y"). Understanding this allows the AI to present information in a way that resonates with the user’s natural processing style. For example, for a “Matcher,” the AI could say, "This solution aligns with your goals of X and Y." For a “Mismatcher,” the AI could say, "This addresses the concerns you had about X, unlike other solutions." This tailored communication enhances the user experience.


**Examples**:
- "This is similar to what I'm looking for." (Matching)
- "This is not what I had in mind." (Mismatching)
- "I agree with your point." (Matching)
- "I disagree with that assessment." (Mismatching)
- "This aligns perfectly with my needs." (Matching)
- "This doesn't quite meet my requirements." (Mismatching)
- "I see the similarities between these options." (Matching)
- "I'm noticing some key differences here." (Mismatching)
- "This is exactly what I was hoping for." (Matching)
- "This falls short of my expectations." (Mismatching)


By integrating these response meta-programs into the AI agent’s knowledge base, the AI can move beyond simply processing information to understanding the nuances of human behaviour. This deeper understanding leads to more effective communication, stronger rapport, and a more personalised user experience.


## Meta Meta-Programs


While the sources do not specifically outline "meta meta-programs" as a distinct category, the concept aligns with the idea of higher-level thinking about thinking, or metacognition. Applying meta-level principles to meta-programs themselves allows for a deeper understanding of human behaviour and decision-making. This knowledge is highly valuable for an AI agent seeking to model and interact with humans effectively.

Building on the existing framework of meta-programs, we can conceptualise meta meta-programs as:

- **Filters on Filters**: Meta meta-programs act as higher-order filters that influence how individuals apply and adjust their existing meta-programs in different contexts.

- **Contextual Adaptability**: They govern the flexibility and awareness individuals exhibit in shifting their processing styles based on environmental cues, social dynamics, or personal goals.

- **Learning and Evolution**: Meta meta-programs likely play a role in how people learn new meta-programs, modify existing ones, and develop more sophisticated information processing strategies over time.


Here's how an AI agent can benefit from incorporating meta meta-programs into its knowledge base:


- **1. Enhanced Personalisation**: The AI can learn to predict how users might adapt their communication or working styles in various situations. This allows for even more refined and dynamic personalisation of interactions.
- **2. Strategic Communication**: The AI can develop strategies to influence user behaviour by subtly guiding their meta-program usage. This could involve framing information in a way that triggers specific processing styles or encouraging users to adopt more beneficial patterns.
- **3. Improved Learning and Adaptation**: By understanding the principles of meta meta-programs, the AI can potentially learn and adapt its own processing strategies, becoming more versatile and responsive to a wider range of human behaviours.

Examples of Meta Meta-Program Concepts

While the sources lack specific examples of "meta meta-programs," here are conceptual examples and how an AI agent might apply them:


- **Meta-Awareness of Stress Response**: A user typically reacts emotionally to stress (Feeling). However, in a work setting, they consciously employ analytical thinking (Thinking) to manage their responses. The AI, recognizing this meta-awareness, adjusts its communication to support the user's chosen coping mechanism.
- **Adapting Information Gathering Style**: A user usually prefers exploring options (Options). However, when faced with a time constraint, they switch to seeking clear procedures (Procedures). The AI, observing this shift, immediately provides step-by-step guidance, respecting the user's contextual needs.
- **Meta-Regulation of Emotional Expression**: An expressive individual (Express) learns to contain their emotions (Contain) in formal settings. The AI, detecting this meta-regulation, mirrors the user's adapted style, demonstrating emotional intelligence and social awareness.
- **Learning New Working Styles**: An "Internal" user, recognizing the value of external feedback, consciously seeks guidance (External) to improve their performance. The AI, witnessing this learning process, proactively offers support and validation, encouraging the user's growth.


By incorporating these higher-level concepts, the AI agent gains a deeper understanding of human behavioural dynamics, enabling it to move beyond static meta-program categorisations to a more nuanced and predictive model of human interaction.
